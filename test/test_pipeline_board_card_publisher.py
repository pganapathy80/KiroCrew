"""The board's card is published WITHOUT a model call, and only for the right session.

Two halves of one claim, and the first is the load-bearing one. Every other dynamic
dashboard card is written by a model reading a transcript: it costs a call, spends an
attempt from one hourly budget shared across the whole gateway, and is therefore gated on
the owner's opt-in to that cost. The conductor's board is assembled from a fold the product
already keeps, so it costs nothing -- and a test that only checked the card APPEARS would
pass equally over an implementation that quietly asked a model to write it, which would put
the one free card on the machine behind a paid switch and let a model restate numbers the
log already answers for.

So the generator is replaced by one that RAISES. Anything reaching it fails loudly rather
than returning a plausible card.

The second half is who gets it. The derived path deliberately drops the ``_created_by``
exclusion the model path applies -- that exclusion exists to stop a fan-out of workers
spending the shared budget, and a derived card spends none, while a conductor dispatched by
another session is exactly the case that must still get its board. Privacy exclusions stay,
because those are not about cost.
